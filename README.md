## Ionic Framework

The Ionic framework allows for the creation of highly interactive, **cross-platform mobile applications** that can be deployed across iOS, Android, and Windows devices. These hybrid applications include native functionalities, exhaustive gestures, and customizable tools to enhance user-friendliness. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Ionic because it provides mobile-friendly `HTML`, `JS`, and `CSS` components to developers.

Some of its advantages are:

- Open source
- Code once, run on all mobile devices
- One programming language for all mobile OS
- Use of well-known web technologies
- A huge community
